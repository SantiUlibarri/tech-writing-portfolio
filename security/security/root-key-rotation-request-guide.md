# Root Key Rotation — Customer Request Guide

## Purpose
This guide explains how to request a root key rotation through approved support channels.

> **Note:** Sanitized portfolio sample. This preserves workflow clarity without revealing internal systems.

---

## Prerequisites
Before submitting a request, ensure you have:
- Administrative authorization for your environment
- A valid reason for rotation (e.g., security policy update, credential compromise, access change)
- Availability for a short maintenance window (if required)

---

## Request Process

### 1) Submit a Support Request
Submit a request through the official support channel with:
- Company name / environment identifier
- Request owner and authorized approver
- Reason for rotation
- Preferred time window (if applicable)

### 2) Authorization & Validation
A support/security representative validates:
- Approver identity and authorization
- Request completeness
- Required prerequisites

If validation fails, the request may be returned for clarification.

### 3) Execution & Confirmation
After approval:
- The rotation is executed by the authorized technical team
- The system is verified for stability
- You receive confirmation once complete

---

## Security Notes
- Root credential details are **never** shared over email or chat.
- Requests without clear authorization will be rejected.

---

## Expected Outcome
A completed root key rotation with confirmation and traceable record of the request.
