# Technical Writing Portfolio | Santiago Fernandez Ulibarri

 **Hi, I'm Santiago.**
I am a Bilingual Technical Writer & UX Content Strategist based in Madrid. I specialize in translating complex engineering concepts into clear, user-centric documentation.

My background includes managing large-scale documentation for **Oracle** (reaching 35,000+ users) and establishing the documentation infrastructure for **Proscai**.

##  About This Repository
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to work within **"Docs-as-Code"** environments—treating documentation like software development. This is essential for modern SaaS companies like OneTrust.

### 1. [Release Notes (JSON Format)](./release-notes-data.json)
* **What it is:** A sample of release notes structured as raw data (JSON).
* **Why it matters:** Modern documentation sites often pull release notes programmatically from data files rather than static text. This demonstrates my ability to:
    * Collaborate with developers in their native formats.
    * Structure content for single-source publishing.
    * Categorize updates by Module, Type (Fix/Feature), and Impact.

### 2. [Security Procedure (Markdown)](./security-procedure-root.md)
* **What it is:** A standard operating procedure (SOP) for a critical root password change.
* **Why it matters:** Written in **Markdown**, the industry standard for technical docs. It demonstrates:
    * Clear information hierarchy (Overview -> Prerequisites -> Execution).
    * Use of warning blocks and check-boxes for safety.
    * Ability to write for technical audiences (System Admins).
